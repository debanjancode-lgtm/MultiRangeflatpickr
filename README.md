This project extends **Flatpickr** to support **multi-range date selection**, a feature that is **not available and not implemented in the default Flatpickr version**.

[Live Demo](https://debanjancode-lgtm.github.io/MultiRangeflatpickr/)


## ❗ Limitation of Default Flatpickr

Flatpickr **does not support multi-range date selection out of the box**.  
Selecting multiple independent date ranges is **not implemented** in the default library and requires custom extension logic.
