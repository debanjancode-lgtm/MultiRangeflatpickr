# 📅 Multi-Range Date Picker (Flatpickr Extended)

This project extends **Flatpickr** to support **multi-range date selection**, a feature that is **not available and not implemented in the default Flatpickr version**.

---

## ❗ Limitation of Default Flatpickr

Flatpickr **does not support multi-range date selection out of the box**.  
Selecting multiple independent date ranges is **not implemented** in the default library and requires custom extension logic.

---
